Description:
Scans network blocks on a given TCP portnumber for certificates found on
plain-SSL/TLS connections, e.g. HTTPS. The output is written in a CSV formatted
file.


Requirements for the tool:
-   Run on a Linux/Unix based system (OSX will work too, Windows when all
    requirements are met)
-   Sipcalc, calculating ipblocks
-   OpenSSL with the x509 and s_client subcommands (default),
    tested on 0.9.8 and 1.0.1e
-   Bash and tested on Dash (POSIX shells)


Files:
run.sh                   - Example script calling "certificate-inventory.sh"
certificate-inventory.sh - Script to parse the user input, select an output
                           file and enumerate the IP addresses in the provided
                           netblocks. (Use this file or run.sh)
download_certificate.sh  - Certificate download script handling 1 IP address
                           Per certificate it will extract the following data:
                           - Host
                           - Port number
                           - Certificate Subject
                           - Certificate Issuer
                           - Public Key size
                           - Serial number
                           - Valid from date
                           - Valid until date
                           - self-signed (yes/no)
                           - Subject Alternative Names (DNS)

Usage examples:
./certificate-inventory.sh --output output.csv 192.168.0.0/24:443 10.0.0.0/18:443

This will scan the two netblock 192.168.0.0/24 and 10.0.0.0/18 on port number
443 (HTTPS), extract the data and push it to the output.csv file. 


Other examples:
./certificate-inventory.sh --output output.csv www.kpn.com:443
./certificate-inventory.sh --output output.csv 192.168.0.11:443
